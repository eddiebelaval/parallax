# How Parallax Works

Parallax is a real-time conflict resolution tool. Two people express themselves — by typing or speaking — and Parallax analyzes each message to surface what's really being said underneath the words.

## Starting a Session

### In-Person Mode
Both people share the same device. You'll go through a short guided onboarding: set your names, choose a context (couple, family, coworkers, etc.), and describe what you'd like to work through. Then you take turns speaking. An X-Ray Scoreboard tracks the discrete issues being raised and whether they're getting addressed.

### Remote Mode
Each person uses their own device. One person creates a session and gets a 6-character room code. The other person enters that code on the Parallax landing page to join. Each person sees their own panel with a shared conversation in the middle. NVC analysis appears in real-time as messages are sent.

## Sending Messages

Type in the text field and press Enter, or click the send button. On Chrome, you can also use voice input — click the microphone button, speak, and your words are transcribed automatically. A waveform orb shows your audio level while speaking.

## Understanding the Analysis

After you send a message, Parallax analyzes it. You'll see several sections appear:

- **Subtext** — What you're really saying beneath the words. The emotional meaning, delivered with compassion.
- **Blind Spots** — Patterns you might not see in your own language. Absolutes ("you always..."), defensive framing, assumptions. These are observations, not judgments.
- **Unmet Needs** — The universal human needs driving your emotion. Things like respect, safety, autonomy, connection, to be heard.
- **NVC Translation** — Your message rewritten using Nonviolent Communication. Vulnerable, warm, human. Something you might actually say.
- **Temperature** — A 0 to 1 score indicating emotional charge. Cool (teal) means calm. Warm (amber) means moderate tension. Hot (rust) means high emotional charge.

## The Melt

When analysis completes, you'll see a visual transformation called The Melt. Your raw message text dissolves into particles, then reforms into the structured NVC insight. This isn't decorative — it represents the actual shift from reactive speech to understood feeling.

## Ending a Session

When you're ready to wrap up, click "End Session." Parallax generates a summary with key takeaways for each person, the overall emotional arc, and suggestions for moving forward.

## Voice Input

Voice input uses the Web Speech API and currently works in Chrome. In other browsers, the microphone button will show a note that voice requires Chrome. You can always type instead.

## Context Modes

When creating a session, you choose a context mode that helps Parallax understand the relationship:

- **Intimate** — Couples, partners, close romantic relationships
- **Family** — Parents, siblings, extended family dynamics
- **Professional Peer** — Coworkers at similar levels
- **Professional Hierarchical** — Manager/report, mentor/mentee
- **Transactional** — Service providers, landlords, business partners
- **Civil/Structural** — Neighbors, community members, institutional disputes

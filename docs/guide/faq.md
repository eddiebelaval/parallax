# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is Parallax a therapist?
No. Parallax is a communication tool, not a replacement for professional therapy or counseling. It helps you see patterns in how you communicate, but it doesn't provide clinical advice, diagnoses, or treatment. If you're in crisis, please reach out to a mental health professional.

## Are my conversations stored?
Conversations exist only during the session. When a session ends, the summary is generated and that's it. Parallax doesn't build profiles, track users across sessions, or store conversation history beyond the active session.

## Why does the analysis sometimes feel off?
The NVC analysis is generated by Claude, a large language model. It's remarkably good at identifying emotional patterns, but it's not perfect. It works best when messages are genuine and substantive. Very short messages ("ok" or "fine") don't give it much to work with.

## Can the other person see my analysis?
In remote mode, each person sees analysis only on messages from the OTHER person — the point is to help you understand what they're really saying. In in-person mode with the X-Ray Scoreboard, both people see all analysis on the shared screen.

## What's the temperature number?
Every message gets a temperature score from 0.0 (completely calm) to 1.0 (very high emotional charge). This isn't a judgment — heated emotions are normal in conflict. The temperature helps you track whether the conversation is escalating or de-escalating over time. You can see this visually in the SignalRail timeline alongside the messages.

## Why does voice only work in Chrome?
Parallax uses the Web Speech API for voice-to-text transcription. This API is currently best supported in Chrome. Other browsers will still work perfectly for text input — the microphone button simply won't appear.

## What are the "14 lenses" I keep hearing about?
The Conflict Intelligence Engine analyzes messages through 14 different analytical frameworks beyond just NVC. These include Gottman's research on relationships, cognitive behavioral therapy patterns, power dynamics, attachment styles, and more. The right lenses activate based on the context mode you choose. You don't need to know about them to use Parallax — they work automatically in the background.

## How do I share a session with someone remote?
Create a remote session from the landing page. You'll get a 6-character room code (like "A7K2MX"). Share that code with the other person. They go to Parallax, enter the code, and join. Both of you are now in the same session on your own devices.

## Can more than two people use Parallax?
Currently, Parallax is designed for two-person conflicts. The NVC analysis, split-screen layout, and X-Ray Scoreboard are all built around a two-person dynamic. Multi-party mediation is a future possibility.

## What is my profile?
Your profile is part of the Intelligence Network — a behavioral map of how you communicate. It's built from a 10-minute conversational interview where Parallax asks about your communication patterns, conflict tendencies, and relationship dynamics. The result is a set of 9 behavioral signals (like attachment style, conflict mode, and emotional regulation patterns) that make future sessions more personalized.

## How do I build a profile?
Sign up for a free account, then complete the interview. It takes about 10 minutes — Parallax asks you questions conversationally, not through a form. Once complete, your signals are automatically used to enrich any session you join. You can view your full profile at /profile.

## What are behavioral signals?
Signals are the patterns Parallax extracts from your interview: attachment style, conflict mode, Gottman risk factors, SCARF sensitivities, drama triangle tendencies, emotional regulation patterns, values, CBT patterns, and narrative themes. Each signal has a confidence score. They help Parallax understand not just what you said, but why you communicate the way you do.

## Is my profile data private?
Yes. Your profile is encrypted at rest and protected by row-level security — only you can see your raw data. When your signals are used in a session, they're anonymized and consent-gated. You choose per-session whether to share signals, and you can revoke consent at any time. Parallax never sells data or trains on your profile.

## What does "fire-and-forget" mean in the architecture?
When you send a message, the app doesn't wait for Claude to finish analyzing it before letting you continue. The message is saved immediately, the analysis runs in the background, and the result appears via real-time subscription when it's ready. This means the conversation feels natural — you never stare at a loading spinner.

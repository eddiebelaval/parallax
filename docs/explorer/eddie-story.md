# Eddie Belaval — The Builder

Eddie Belaval is the founder of id8Labs, a Florida-based company building AI-augmented products. His philosophy is simple and relentless: ship fast, iterate faster. He believes in cognitive leverage — AI handles the repetition, humans handle the strategy. Every product he builds embodies this principle.

## How Parallax Happened

Parallax started life as "Pause" — a simpler app focused on reflection and mindfulness for couples. But during the build, something unexpected happened. The NVC (Nonviolent Communication) analysis that Claude was generating wasn't just good — it was revelatory. It saw things in conversations that neither person could see themselves. Blind spots. Subtext. The real need hiding behind the angry words.

That was the moment Pause became Parallax. The product pivoted from "meditation tool" to "real-time conflict resolution platform." The NVC analysis wasn't a feature — it was the entire product.

## The Claude + Eddie Collaboration

Eddie and Claude work together using a pattern called Director/Builder. Eddie is the Director — he makes strategic decisions, shapes creative direction, writes the vision documents, and decides what gets built and what gets cut. Claude is the Builder — executing implementation, writing code, debugging, and shipping.

This isn't prompt engineering. This is collaboration. Eddie doesn't write prompts and wait for output. He thinks out loud, iterates on ideas in real-time, and Claude responds with architecture, code, and honest pushback when something doesn't make sense. The commit history of Parallax reads like a conversation between two builders — because that's exactly what it is.

They follow the ID8 Pipeline methodology: an 11-stage build process (Concept Lock through Ship and Iterate) where every stage has a gate question that must be answered before advancing. Every commit references its stage. Every decision is documented in BUILDING.md. The pipeline isn't bureaucracy — it's a forcing function for clarity.

## Design Philosophy

Eddie has two distinct design languages across his products:

"Factory-Inspired" is the id8Labs identity — near-black backgrounds, warm grays, orange accents, Geist typography, no shadows or gradients. Professional tools that look like they were built in a machine shop.

"Ember" is Parallax's design system — warm chocolate dark mode, earthy organic tones, temperature-reactive colors where light encodes emotional data. The design principle is "Light = Data." Every glow, every color shift carries meaning. Nothing is decorative.

Eddie is a visual learner. He processes complex systems spatially, not sequentially. That's why Parallax has interactive HTML blueprints for every major feature — architecture maps you can explore, not documents you read linearly.

## The Products

Eddie builds across a range of domains, all tied together by the AI-augmented philosophy:

Homer is a real estate dashboard built on Next.js and Supabase, live at tryhomer.vip. HYDRA is a multi-agent automation system that runs 14 jobs on his Mac Studio via launchd — shell scripts, Claude, and Telegram, coordinating at near-zero cost. Vox is a macOS speech-to-text tool built in Swift with whisper.cpp. DeepStack is a trading bot for prediction markets (currently paused).

Parallax is the hackathon entry — built from scratch in one week for the Claude Code Hackathon, February 10-16, 2026.

## What Drives Him

Eddie believes that the gap between "having a conflict" and "getting help with a conflict" is absurdly wide. Professional mediation costs $300-500/hour. Therapy waitlists stretch for months. Most people just keep arguing the same way — talking past each other, building resentment, never seeing the pattern.

Parallax exists because that gap shouldn't exist anymore. Not when AI can see what both people are really saying and reflect it back in a way they can actually hear.

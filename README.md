# Parallax

Real-time two-person conflict resolution powered by Claude.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16 (App Router, TypeScript strict)
- Tailwind CSS v4 with factory design tokens
- React 19
- Supabase (Realtime, Auth, Postgres)

## Development

```bash
npm run dev    # Start dev server (Turbopack)
npm run build  # Production build
npm run lint   # ESLint
```

## Design System

Factory-inspired: near-black `#020202`, near-white `#eeeeee`, warm neutral grays, orange `#ef6f2e` accent. Geist + Geist Mono fonts. No shadows, no gradients, no glow.
